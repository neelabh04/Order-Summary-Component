# Order Summary Card 👋
This is a practice project in which I tried to make a sample page using just HTML and CSS. I made this in order understand the core concepts of HTML and CSS properly.

## Overview 
### What is an order summary ? 

It shows the summary about the order/service that we have purchased from a website. This is usually the page that just comes before payment page. 

Order summary tells about the items we are yet to purchase from the websit and how much money we are spending for it. 

_I have built only one component of summary page using HTML and CSS only._

## My process
### Built with
- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned
In this project I tried to understood how HTML and CSS works in harmony with each other. I learnt a lot about `tags` , `selectors`, `classes` in HTML and CSS.

In the HTML learning, I found out how the`div` tags are used in one another and how their properties and values get passed down from the parent div to child div.

In the CSS learning, I found out how to style certain div elements so that their properties won't be inherited by their children div. It also helped me to understand esentially how the `CSS Box Model` works and the beauty of it. 

I also found it challenging to make elements and tags to appear `center` and `aligned`. 
  
### Continued development
I have done this project in order to understand the fundamental concepts of CSS and HTML. I will be creating another project with similar idea and try to use javascript in that.
